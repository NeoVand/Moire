## üé® Pattern Types & Creative Techniques

### **Lines** - Classic Moir√© Foundation
- Parallel line gratings for traditional interference patterns
- **Best for**: Understanding basic Moir√© theory
- **Tip**: Try rotation differences of 1-5¬∞ for prominent bands

### **Circles** - Radial Interference
- Concentric circle patterns creating radial interference
- **Best for**: Hyperbolic and elliptical patterns
- **Tip**: Combine different frequencies for complex radial effects

### **Radial** - Spoke Patterns  
- Lines radiating from center point
- **Best for**: Kaleidoscopic and starburst effects
- **Tip**: Use Fill mode for solid pie-slice patterns

### **Dots** - Texture & Grain Effects
- Regular dot grid patterns
- **Best for**: Texture-like interference and halftone effects
- **Tip**: Vary thickness to change dot sizes

### **Checkerboard** - Square Grid Interference
- Alternating square patterns
- **Best for**: 2D grid interference demonstrations
- **Tip**: Small rotations create diagonal moir√© bands

### **Hexagonal** - Advanced Tessellation
- Mathematically accurate hexagonal grids
- **Best for**: Scientific visualization (graphene, crystal structures)
- **Tip**: Layer different scales for complex superlattice patterns

## üî¨ Mathematical Foundation

This application implements scientifically accurate Moir√© interference based on:

- **Beat Frequency Theory**: Large-scale patterns from small frequency differences

- **Multi-layer Composition**: Complex interference from simple primitives
- **Real-time Calculations**: 60fps rendering with mathematical precision
- **Twistronics Simulation**: Hexagonal patterns inspired by graphene research

### Key Mathematical Concepts:
- **Moir√© Period**: `p_moire ‚âà (p‚ÇÅ √ó p‚ÇÇ) / |p‚ÇÅ - p‚ÇÇ|` for frequency differences
- **Angular Moir√©**: Rotation-based interference with `~Œ∏/2` band orientation
- **Translation Effects**: Position-based phase relationships
- **Multiplicative Blending**: Proper optical interference simulation
